## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an accurate churn prediction model by performing comprehensive data preprocessing. This involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing data to enhance the model's performance and reliability. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Key Steps Involved:

1.Installation of Required Libraries:
Install and import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and any other relevant tools for data manipulation and preprocessing.

2.Loading the Data:
Load the customer data from various sources (e.g., CSV files, databases). Ensure that the data is correctly imported and ready for preprocessing.

3.Data Cleaning:
    Handling Missing Values: Identify and address missing values through imputation or removal, depending on their impact on the dataset.
    Removing Duplicates: Check for and remove any duplicate records to ensure the dataset's integrity.
    Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers to prevent them from skewing the analysis.
    
4.Feature Engineering:
    Creating New Features: Derive new features that may improve model performance (e.g., tenure, average purchase frequency).
    Feature Selection: Select relevant features based on their importance and impact on the churn prediction.
    
5.Encoding Categorical Variables:
    One-Hot Encoding: Convert categorical variables into binary vectors to enable their use in machine learning models.
    Label Encoding: Assign numerical values to categorical data if applicable.
    
6.Splitting the Dataset:
    Training and Test Sets: Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
    Validation Set (Optional): Further split the training set into training and validation sets for tuning hyperparameters.
    
7.Feature Scaling:
    Standardization: Normalize features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.
    
8.Data Transformation:
    Normalization: Scale features to a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 1) if required for specific models.

## Result Interpretation:
In case 1, the similarity score between the resume1 file and the job description file is approximately 56.68%. This means that the resume matches the job description by 56.68%, indicating a moderate level of relevance.
